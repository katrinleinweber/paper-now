For BFM and SEM observations, we cultured Achnanthidium minutissimum xenically and axenically on Thermanox disks. After incubation periods of 11 to 31 days, the disk surfaces in xenic cultures were densely covered by a mono-layer of *A. minutissimum* cells ([Fig. 1](#f1-cv-chl)). This biofilm was visible by eye as a light greenish-brown coloration on the substrate disks after removal from the medium. Staining with the dye crystal violet (CV) and subsequent bright-field microscopy showed that large portions of the diatom cells were surrounded by capsules.

In contrast, axenic *A. minutissimum* cells did not form biofilms, so that even careful rinsing left much fewer cells attached to the disks and thus available for SEM analysis. This observation is in agreement with studies that utilised other growth substrates to compare biofilm formation by axenic and xenic diatom cultures. By measuring chlorophyll contents, the possibility that axenic cells might simply be less proliferate was excluded ([Windler et al., 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.12280/abstract)). Xenic *A. minutissimum* cultures on the other hand have also been found to develop biofilms on glass beads as well as in plastic multi-well plates ([Lubarsky et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013794); [Windler et al., 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.12280/abstract)). Our results demonstrate, that xenic biofilms of *A. minutissimum* can also be grown on Thermanox disks, enabling direct preparation for electron microscopy of native biofilm samples.

### Identification of *A. minutissimum* capsule microstructures

In order to correlate the hydrated *A. minutissimum* capsules visible in light microscopy to their dehydrated appearance in SEM, areas were marked by scratches on the CV stained disks and cells of interest were identified by BFM. Subsequently, the same areas and cells were found again in the SEM ([Fig. 2](#f2-clem)). The same technique was successfully applied to axenic cultures, despite the lower prevalence of adherent cells ([Suppl. Fig. 1](#sf1-clem-ax)).

In BFM, the CV stained capsules were visible as voluminous, rounded structures around most of the cells. As extracellular polymeric structures in the genus Achnanthidium are composed mostly of carbohydrates ([Wustman et al., 1998](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/116/4/1431); [Windler et al., 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.12280/abstract)), strong hydration in the native biofilm is likely the source of this appearance of the capsules. In SEM, we were able to distinguish two types of *A. minutissimum* cells in xenic biofilms already at low magnifications: cells with pores in their frustules still visible, and cells covered by an apparently unstructured material masking the pores.

The frustules of non-encapsulated xenic, as well as axenic *A. minutissimum* cells appeared identical to those from scanning electron micrographs shown in previous studies ([Mayama & Kobayasi, 1989](https://doi.org/10.1080/0269249X.1989.9705056); [Potapova & Hamilton, 2007](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2007.00332.x/abstract); [Hlúbiková, Ector & Hoffmann, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1127/1864-1318/2011/0136-0019)). The low prevalence of raphes in our images is most likely due to their orientation towards the substrate for mucilage secretion ([Gordon & Drum, 1970](http://www.pnas.org/content/67/1/338); [Wetherbee et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.1998.340009.x)). Natural attachment and orientation of cells on our biofilm disks was retained because we did not employ harsh preparation techniques, such as boiling the diatom cells in sulphuric acid ([Mayama & Kobayasi, 1989](https://doi.org/10.1080/0269249X.1989.9705056)). Such harsh treatments are designed to prepare only frustules and in our case would likely have resulted in cell detachment from the growth substrate, as well as random orientation on the SEM sample carrier. Instead, we utilised the SEM sample carrier disks directly as growth substrates for the biofilms.

The SEM images in [figure 3](#f3-compare) show that the capsule material appears to be unstructured or slightly granular, resembling the "adhering film and tube" of *Cymbella microcephala* and *Cymbella prostrata* reported in figures 31 and 32 of ([Hoagland et al., 1993](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1993.00537.x/abstract)) and also the shaft ultra-structure of the marine diatom *Achnanthes longipes* displayed in figure 8 of [Wang et al., 2000](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1529-8817.2000.99102.x/abstract).

In addition to covering the cells, the capsule material also had sheet-like structures (arrows in [Fig. 3A](#f3-compare)) where it was stretched between *A. minutissimum* cells and the anchoring points on the substrate. This pattern is most likely due to dehydration during SEM sample preparation ([Hoagland et al., 1993](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1993.00537.x/abstract)). Due to fixation of the samples prior to drying, the hydrated capsules most likely shrank in their entirety.

### Fibrillar precursors may give rise to *A. minutissimum* capsules

Closer inspection provided many examples that the frustules of non-encapsulated xenic *A. minutissimum* cells were not completely free of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Instead, they were covered by a mesh of fibrils ([Fig. 3B](#f3-compare)), arranged mostly around the frustule pores, sometimes crossing them and sometimes sticking out. The average diameter of these fibrils was about 45 ± 9 nm. The fibrils were rarely observed to be secreted through the pores, although these were found to be large enough (from 60 to 140 nm in diameter), showing round to elongated shapes. Fibrils were generally longer than the diameter of pores, but quantification was not performed because branching and interweaving of the fibrils made it impossible to determine the respective beginnings or ends. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of frustule-attached fibril structures in freshwater diatoms. Similarly structured, thinner fibrils were reported previously only for marine diatoms ([Bosak et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0044851)).

Fibrillar meshes of varying densities were detected in both axenic and xenic cultures, but only the latter also contained capsules. Axenic cultures appeared to contain more cells with few, short fibrils ([Suppl. Fig. 2](#sf2-ax-fibrils)), which may initiate surface attachment of cells in both culture types. However, only in xenic cultures, bacteria could induce the secretion of firmer EPS structures ([Bruckner et al., 2011](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02411.x/full)), and thus substrate adhesion, in the majority of cells.

Furthermore, we found intermediate stages between the fibrillar meshes that covered the frustule surface  only partially and the complete encapsulation with apparently unstructured material ([Fig. 4](#f4-stages)). The similarity in surface structure suggests a relation of fibrils and capsules. The disordered arrangement of fibrils shown in [figure 4](#f4-stages)A and B is also a feature of the unstructured capsule material shown in [figure 4C](#f4-stages). In it, no particular order of the slightly granular substructures is discernible either. This visual impression suggests that the fibrillar meshes on *A. minutissimum* cells might be precursors to capsules, into which the fibrils may condense. An alternative explanation for the capsule structure may be the polymerisation of a secondary type of fibrils upon the primary mesh ([Fig. 4A](#f4-stages)), relegating the latter to a scaffolding function.

In either case, the fibril formation is not strictly synchronised between cells in the same culture. It rather appears to be a function of each cell's individual age, because different stages appeared both on days 11 and 31 of incubation, as well as in between. To further elucidate whether or not fibrils and capsules might be related, we analysed mechanically stressed capsule areas ([Fig. 5](#f5-material)). Here, tension yielded an alignment of capsule microstructures, as well as fraying on the edges. Fibrillar structures resulting from these processes were similar in diameter to the frustule-covering fibrils.

There are two possible sources for the mechanical force. Firstly, motility of the cells relative to each other in the native biofilm. However, it has been reported for a related species in the order Achnanthales, that motility is lost upon production of EPS structures ([Wang et al., 1997](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/113/4/1071)). Secondly, mechanical force could be caused by the dehydration during SEM sample preparation. Both explanations lead to the question why mechanical force highlighted the fibrillar microstructure, while relaxed capsule areas (see previous figures) appeared unstructured. Micromanipulation experiments may be required to further investigate the properties of *A. minutissimum* capsules and their fibrillar microstructures. Such experiments have been conducted by force-mode AFM on the mucilage layers of other diatoms ([Higgins et al., 2003](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1529-8817.2003.02163.x/abstract); [Willis et al., 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.12103/abstract)).

Based on this data, we suggest fibrils as a precursor candidate for capsules. Fibrils may condense into the capsule material as depicted in [figure 4](#f4-stages), for example by enzymatic cross-linking or transglycosylase activity. Fibrils may be disguised in relaxed capsule material because they are arranged in a disorderly fashion, but mechanical stress yielded a visible alignment.

### Capsule material does not contain silicon

Silicon (Si) is a major component of diatom frustules, in which it is present as hydrated silicon dioxide. Capsules on the other hand may consist mostly of extracellular polymeric carbohydrates ([Wustman et al., 1998](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/116/4/1431); [Windler et al., 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.12280/abstract)). In order to exclude the possibility that the capsule material we observed might represent frustule deformations or extensions ([Windler et al., 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pre.12059/abstract); [Cantonati et al., 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969713011625)) it was screened for the presence of Si. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra were recorded from capsule areas with and without a cell body and thus a frustule below them ([Fig. 6](#f6-edx)).

As expected, higher counts around 1.75 keV, which signifies Si ([Guerra et al., 2013](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/ja/c3ja50084e); [Chandrasekaran et al., 2014](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/cc/c4cc04470c)), were obtained from capsule material, than from cell bodies. Background level Si counts likely result from the frustule edges close-by due to the "pear effect" ([Arnould & Hild, 2007](http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3636)). It explains, how excited electrons diffuse into the sample, so that a pear-shaped volume of ca. 0.5-1 µm diameter below the measurement point or area also emits detectable X-rays. The cell bodies in this figure are separated by approximately that distance. The stronger gold (Au) signal of the capsule material around 2.15 keV compared to the control areas probably resulted from the larger sputtered surface area within the measurement volume. Due to the absence of notable Si signals from *A. minutissimum* capsule material, we can exclude the possibility that it is some kind of frustule extension or deformation.

Furthermore, we can tentatively exclude chitin as a major component of the capsule material, because no notable nitrogen signals (N; 0.39 keV) were recorded from it. Chitin fibrils have been found to be secreted by diatoms into the surrounding water body ([Gardner & Blackwell, 1971](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/polc.5070360124/abstract); [Herth, 1979](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022532079901382)). In contrast, the fibrillar meshes we describe here, tightly covered the frustule surfaces of individual *A. minutissimum* cells and therefore likely represent different EPS structures.

### Bacteria preferentially attach to encapsulated diatom cells

It became apparent during the SEM observations, that diatom-attached bacteria cells occurred more often on capsules than on frustules. To substantiate this observation, bacteria cells were counted on both diatom cell surface types ([Fig. 7](#f7-attach)).
Notably higher numbers of bacteria (ca. 25 times more on average) adhered to capsules than to frustules throughout the stationary phase (means: 11.41±8.23 and 0.46±0.82 respectively). The variance in the numbers of bacteria per diatom was larger (ca. 100 times) on encapsulated cells than on frustules, indicating that not all encapsulated *A. minutissimum* cells were equally strongly colonised by bacteria. Presumably, this is due to the population dynamics of the co-isolated bacteria within different areas of the xenic biofilms.

Bacteria as well as diatom cells with only fibrillar meshes on their frustule were found to individually retain attachment to the substrate. We deem it unlikely that attachment to each other could have been too weak to withstand the rinsing step. Instead, the bacteria preferentially adhered to capsules, while either being actively repelled from non-encapsulated *A. minutissimum* cells or only not especially drawn to their frustules.

It has been proposed that *A. minutissimum* capsules might be an asset in the mutualistic relationship of this diatom with its satellite bacteria ([Windler et al., 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.12280/abstract)). Previous findings suggest a pattern of bacterial adherence to *A. minutissimum* cells in xenic biofilms that would support this hypothesis ([Windler, Gruber & Kroth, 2012](http://zs.thulb.uni-jena.de/receive/jportal_jparticle_00273835)): diatom cells were surrounded by a bacteria-free space, followed by a layer of densely aggregated bacteria cells. Although no CV stains were conducted in that study, the bacteria-free regions resemble the EPS structures reported since then as capsules.

In bacterial biofilms, nutrient distribution is predominantly determined by diffusion, sometimes along strong gradients within a biofilm ([Stewart, 2003](http://jb.asm.org/content/185/5/1485)). Similarly, variations of cellular nutrient distributions within freshwater diatom biofilms exist ([Murdock et al., 2010](http://www.chromatographyonline.com/lcgc/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=691454&sk=&date=&pageID=4)). Furthermore, it is possible that diatom capsules serve as a common nutrient pool to the satellite bacteria in a mutualistic relationship ([Bruckner et al., 2008](http://aem.asm.org/content/74/24/7740.full)). Therefore, competition between individual diatom cells for re-mineralising bacteria could occur. Nutrient-limited, but still photosynthetically active diatom cells may produce predominantly insoluble carbohydrates to foster close attachment of heterotrophic bacteria that re-mineralise EPS or secrete vitamins.

Our finding that bacteria attach preferentially to capsules strengthens the argument that capsules play a role in the inter-kingdom relationship of satellite bacteria and benthic diatoms. Whether this relationship is antagonistic, mutualistic or commensal in nature remains to be elucidated. Labelling experiments with isotopes or fluorophores may assist in the determination of carbohydrate fluxes from the diatom's EPS structures to bacteria feeding on those.
