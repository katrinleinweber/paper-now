title: "Capsule material in xenic *A. minutissimum* biofilms does not contain silicon and can thus be distinguished from the frustule."
description: "Samples were taken from 11 days old culture. **A:** Scanning electron micrograph of capsule material  that is stretched between *A. minutissimum* cells (partially visible). Labels indicate energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurement points. **B:** EDX spectra show that less silicon (peak around 1.75 keV, with grey background) is found in the capsule material without cell body below it (black trace) compared to the control points on the cell bodies (blue and turquoise traces). Stronger Au signal around 2.15 keV likely results from larger gold-sputtered surface area in close proximity to the 'capsule' measurement point."
