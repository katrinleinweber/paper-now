title: "Scanning electron micrographs of fibril-covered *A. minutissimum* frustules from axenic culture."
description: "Samples were prepared for SEM after 20 days of incubation. **A** (scale bar: 1 µm) & **B** (scale bar: 200 nm): Frustules with few, short fibrils, which were not found in xenic biofilms. **C** (scale bar: 1 µm) & **D** (scale bar: 200 nm): Frustule with medium-dense fibrillar mesh, as also seen in xenic biofilm (main figure 4A). **E** (scale bar: 200 nm): Fibrils are not only flatly attached to the frustule but also stick out into space and make contact with other cells (arrows), as also seen in xenic cultures (main figure 4B)."
