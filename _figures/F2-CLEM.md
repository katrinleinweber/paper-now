title: "Identification of *A. minutissimum* capsules (asterisks) by successive observation of cell clusters by first bright-field and then scanning electron microscopy of xenic biofilm (scale bars: 5 Âµm)."
description: "**A:** Bright-field micrograph of crystal violet (CV) stained, 31 days old culture. Encapsulated cells (asterisks) are strongly stained, while weak staining indicates few extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the frustule surfaces. **B:** Scanning electron micrograph of the the same cell cluster. Encapsulated cells (asterisks) are surrounded by an opaque material. Frustule pores are visible on cells that did not possess a capsule in the hydrated biofilm. Note also the unequal distribution of bacteria cells on capsules versus non-encapsulated frustules."
